# Saurth

Provides an interface which I will create a web server to access similar to a wiki. But the project will act a module which you can write your own interface and use your own protocol for exchange of data.

I aspire to have a user control system with permissions as listed in the next section. There will also be support for international organisations and events as well as news posts and maybe even maps.


## Role Permissions
- rc - read content
- cc - create content //create content on countries/orgs that you own or have permission to edit from their owners and polls
- ep - event participation - create and be able to join events
- io - create international organisations
- cm - create more channels
- hc - hide content of others
- dc - delete content of others
- em - edit map
- cs - currency system (manages the exchange and currency)
- cf - curate front page and also other non nation or org pages
- bu - ban users
- an - accept new nations
- rn - remove nation
- sn - suspend nation
- mr - manage users roles below theirs
- al - audit log
